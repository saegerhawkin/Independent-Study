# Machine Learning Independent Study #
<strong>Background: </strong><br>
I wanted to gain more expereince with machine learning methods because I believe it is an essential skill for data analysts. Many job descriptions list machine learning as a skill they want in their applicants. I approached the head of our analytics department to oversee an independent study for me so I could develop these skills. 

<br><strong>Project: </strong><br>
I am working with the data from the World Values survey in this project. You can find more information about the data and the survey here: http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs.jsp. The goal of the project is to predict life satisfaction using other variables from the survey. I am limiting the data to the United States, as different countries find satisfaction from different sources. 

<br><strong>Tools: </strong><br>
To do the analysis I am using Python in Jupyter Labs. To organize my packages, I am using Anaconda.
